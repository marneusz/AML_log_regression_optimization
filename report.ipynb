    "Since the model need to be trained and tested, there is a need to prepare some data. We collected 5 datasets:\n",
    " * **candies** - dataset concerning production of candies. Sample questions addressed by the variables: *Does it contain chocolate?, Is it fruit flavored?, Is there caramel in the candy?, Does it contain peanuts, peanut butter or almonds?, Does it contain nougat?*.
