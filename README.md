The aim of the project is to implement different optimization algorithms for logistic regression and  compare their performance. 

## Part 1

* Finding 5 different datasets with binary class variable. We can use [Datasets archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). 
* Preparing data: missing values, converting categorical variables (e.g. one-hot encoding), removing colinear variables, split data into training and testing sets

## Part 2
Implementing measures of classification performance: accuracy, recall, precision, F measure (harmonic mean between recall and precision).

## Part 3
Implementing optimization algorithms for parameter estimation:
* IWLS (Iterative Reweighted Least Squares)
* GD (Gradient Descent)
* SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

## Part 4 
Experiments. Details in `Project 1.pdf`

## Final grade
Based on:
* Source codes
* Report (max 4 pages A4, mostly results of Part 4)
* Presentation (max 5 minutes)

## DEADLINES 
* Code: April 7 2021 or April 14 2021
* Presentations: April 14 2021 or April 21 2021
